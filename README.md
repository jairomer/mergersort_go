# mergersort_go

## What is this?

An implementation in golang of mergesort.

## Why?

I am interested in learning go, and over time I have found that implementing mergesort is a good exercise to expose oneself to the basic features of a new programming language.

## How?

There are two implementations:
- Classic: Using recursion.
- Concurrent: Using go coroutines.
